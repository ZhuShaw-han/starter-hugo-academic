She has genuine passion for life science and is fascinated by the simple, elegant laws that emerging from complex dynamical systems and natural phenomenon. Xiaohan works extensively in laboratory during her undergraduate years. and has rich research experience in biophysics (microbial community dynamisc), analytical chemistry (chromatography, polarity parameter model, molecular docking), and machine learning, etc. 

Xiaohan is now doing her research on Microbial Community assembly, coalescence and historical contingency at Gore Lab, MIT. 

Xiaohan believes that a more diversified and comprehensive knowledge system, solid mathematical and mechanical basis and various research experience in college CAN help her obtain better sense in life science, bring innovative perspectives to biological field and carry out distinguishing research in biological field in the long run. 

In her free time, she likes hiking, running, and rope skipping. She is a member of the THU Rope-skipping Freestyle team, and won the championship for two consecutive years in THU Ma Yuehan Cup Women 60-sec single-jump speed race.
