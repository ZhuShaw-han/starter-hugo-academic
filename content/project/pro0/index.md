*Adviser*: Jintian Tang; Professor in Department of Engineering Physics, Tsinghua University. 

*Project Area*: 
Analytical Chemistry - Separation and purification.

\- In this project, I helped building an efficient strategy for the selection of active compounds from blueberry based on counter-current fractionation and bioassay-guided separation by assisting some of the experiments and contributing ideas. The molecular dynamics analysis of the interaction between purified compound and enzyme was also conducted.

\- I got familiar with multispectral scanning, molecular docking and other biochemistry analysis techniques. One paper were published on this project:

Counter-current fractionation-assisted bioassay-guided separation of active compound from blueberry and the interaction between the active compound and Î±-glucosidase. *Foods, 10*(3), 509.
