Project Area: 
Analytical Chemistry - Chromatography.

\-	This project provided a rapid and simple method for the separation of unknow compounds. I used liquid-liquid separation technology coupled with High-Speed Countercurrent Chromatography (HSCCC) to separate high-purity compounds from complex natural compounds. 

\-	Found and experimentally verified a strong relationship between the compound polarity calculated through HPLC and the average polarity of the 2-liquid-phase solvent system in which the compound was evenly distributed. I established, refined and verified the parameter model through experiments. Based on this model, the goal of quickly finding the applicable HSCCC two-phase solvent system based on the compound polarity model was achieved. 

\-	Mastered HPLC, HSCCC, other chromatographic techniques, and basic analytical chemistry experimental skills after finishing this project. First-authored paper has been submitted to Journal of Chromatography A and is under review.
